# Data_Modelling_Postgres
Transform Sparkify heterogenous database into homogenous for the final query 

# Abstract 
Sparkigy (imiginary music app)  analyst wants to know the user activity on the number of the songs they have listen too. The songs file comes in the form of JSON logs and JSON metadata. They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. So that the Sparkify analytical team can query the structure data based on their objectives.
